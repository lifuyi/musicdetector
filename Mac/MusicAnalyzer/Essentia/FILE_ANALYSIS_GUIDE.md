# 📁 File Analysis Guide - How to Get Results

## 🔍 **How File Analysis Works**

The app **analyzes audio files** but does **not play them**. Here's how to get analysis results:

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

#### **1. Select Audio File**
```
1. Click "Audio File" button in the app
2. Click "Select Audio File" 
3. Choose your music file (MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, FLAC, OGG)
4. File path will appear in the interface
```

#### **2. Analysis Starts Automatically**
```
✅ Progress bar appears showing analysis progress
✅ Audio level indicator shows file processing activity  
✅ Analysis completes in 2-10 seconds (as requested)
✅ Results appear in the main interface
```

#### **3. View Analysis Results**
```
Results appear in these locations:

📊 Main Interface:
   - BPM (beats per minute)
   - Key (C, D, E, F, G, A, B)
   - Scale (major/minor)
   - Confidence percentage
   - Detected chords

📈 Analysis History Panel:
   - Timestamped results
   - Confidence indicators
   - Chord progressions

📋 Right Panel:
   - Detailed analysis breakdown
   - Historical analysis data
```

## 🎯 **Where to Find Your Results**

### **Immediate Results (Left Panel)**
- **BPM Display**: Large number showing beats per minute
- **Key Display**: Shows musical key and scale
- **Confidence Meter**: 5-dot indicator showing accuracy
- **Current Chords**: Grid showing detected chords

### **Detailed Results (Right Panel)**
- **Analysis History**: List of all analysis results with timestamps
- **Confidence Scores**: Percentage accuracy for each result
- **Chord Progressions**: Timeline of chord changes

### **Export Results**
```
1. Click "Export" button after analysis
2. Choose format: JSON, CSV, MIDI, XML, or Text
3. Save results to your preferred location
4. Open saved file to view detailed analysis data
```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **File Analysis vs File Playback**
- ✅ **Analysis**: The app reads and analyzes audio files
- ❌ **Playback**: The app does NOT play audio files
- 🎯 **Purpose**: This is an analysis tool, not a music player

### **Why No Playback?**
```
The app is designed for:
✅ Real-time analysis (microphone input)
✅ File analysis (processing audio data)
✅ URL streaming analysis
✅ Professional music analysis workflows

NOT for:
❌ Music playback
❌ Audio entertainment
❌ Music player functionality
```

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting File Analysis**

### **If Analysis Doesn't Start:**
```
1. Check file format (must be: MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, FLAC, OGG)
2. Ensure file is not corrupted
3. Try a different audio file
4. Check error messages in the app
```

### **If No Results Appear:**
```
1. Wait for analysis to complete (up to 10 seconds)
2. Check confidence threshold in Settings
3. Look in Analysis History panel (right side)
4. Try with a longer audio file (>30 seconds recommended)
```

### **Common Issues:**
```
❌ "File not found" → Check file path and permissions
❌ "Unsupported format" → Use supported audio formats
❌ "Analysis failed" → Try different file or check file integrity
❌ Low confidence → Use higher quality audio files
```

## 📊 **Sample Analysis Output**

### **What You'll See:**
```
Main Display:
┌─────────────────┐
│ BPM: 128.5      │
│ Key: C major    │
│ Confidence: 85% │
│ Chords: C F G Am│
└─────────────────┘

Analysis History:
• 14:30:15 - BPM: 128.5, Key: C major, Confidence: 85%
• 14:29:42 - BPM: 120.1, Key: G major, Confidence: 92%
• 14:28:58 - BPM: 140.3, Key: E minor, Confidence: 78%
```

### **Exported JSON Result:**
```json
{
  "bpm": 128.5,
  "key": "C",
  "scale": "major", 
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:15Z",
  "chords": [
    {"chord": "C", "confidence": 0.9, "startTime": 0.0},
    {"chord": "F", "confidence": 0.85, "startTime": 2.5}
  ]
}
```

## 🎵 **Alternative: Use Microphone for Playback Analysis**

### **If You Want to Analyze While Listening:**
```
1. Select "Microphone" input in the app
2. Click "Start Live Analysis"
3. Play your audio file through speakers
4. The app will capture and analyze the audio in real-time
5. You get both: music playback + live analysis
```

### **Benefits of Microphone Method:**
- ✅ Hear the music while analyzing
- ✅ Real-time visual feedback
- ✅ Can analyze any audio source (Spotify, YouTube, etc.)
- ✅ Live spectrum visualization

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **To Get File Analysis Results:**
1. **Try the file analysis** with a known music file
2. **Check the right panel** for detailed results
3. **Export results** if you need to save them
4. **Use microphone method** if you want to hear the music

### **For Advanced Analysis:**
1. **Adjust settings** for better accuracy
2. **Export to MIDI** for DAW integration
3. **Use batch analysis** for multiple files
4. **Integrate real Essentia** for production accuracy

The app is working correctly - it's an **analysis tool**, not a music player! Results appear automatically after file analysis completes.
